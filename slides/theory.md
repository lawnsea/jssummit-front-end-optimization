# Theory and method of performance optimization


## What is performance optimization?


At its core, performance optimization is the process of identifying inefficient
use of system resources and improving the situation.

It is both an art *and* a science. It requires creativity, persistence,
discipline, and attention to detail.


## How is performance optimized?

The major activities of optimization include

- setting goals
- modeling
- instrumentation
- identifying optimization opportunities
- experimentation
- analysis


## Setting goals

The first step is to decide what you want to accomplish.

Goals must be attainable.

Goals should not be arbitrary, they should be driven by business requirements,
user experience, and other real-world motivations.

Goals must be measurable.

Notes:
- an unnamed client wanted us to load in 30ms, which is less than SF<->NYC
  latency


## Modeling

A **model** is an abstract, mathematical representation of a system. Models are
never completely precise or accurate, but good ones allow us to analyze and make
predictions about changes to the system.

Notes:
gonna need math, sorry not sorry


## Instrumentation

**Instrumentation** is the process of modifying an application to gather and
report performance measurement data.


### User Timing API

The [User Timing API](http://caniuse.com/user-timing) provides a means to
measure durations with sub-millisecond precision. It exposes a simple but
powerful API that is easily
[polyfillable](https://www.npmjs.org/package/usertiming).

Many development tools - including the Chrome Dev Tools and WebPagetest - detect
and display measurements captured with the User Timing API.


### Collection

This is the hard part: getting performance data from the browser to a server for
later analysis. There are three broad approaches to the problem:

- Fully-hosted (Google Analytics, splunk, e.g.)
- Self-hosted off the shelf software (statsd, e.g.)
- Roll your own

Any of these will work, but solving this problem in a manner that is reliable
and scalable is *hard*.


## Identifying Optimization Opportunities


## Experimentation


### Experimental method

- Ask a question
- Form a hypothesis
- Test the hypothesis
- Analyze the collected data

A good experiment is *focused* and *repeatable*.


## Analysis

Performance data rarely conforms to a standard distribution, so mean and
standard deviation are typically not very helpful.

Instead, examine the minimum and maximum, as well as the median and two or three
other percentiles, such as the 75th, 95th, and 99th.

Plotting experimental results can be very helpful.

Useful visualization tools include spreadsheet programs like Excel or
LibreOffice Calc, gnuplot, and R.

Notes:
TODO: break this into two or three slides, including a standard distribution, a
non-standard distribution, and something that shows percentiles
- distributions
- probability density
- modal vs multimodal
- min, max, median and percentiles sted of mean
TODO: talk about waterfalls
- waterfall
- chrome timeline
- sapa


## Closing the loop

After analysis is complete, it is time to begin the process again.

Analysis may drive refinements to your model, suggest instrumentation points, or
highlight new opportunities for optimization.
